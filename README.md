# Club Calendar
This is an application that improves the process of adding and seeing club events on campus. Previously it was an arduous task  to add a club event on campus; with this application, it makes it much easier. This application was created by Matthew Benhke, Emerson Flom and Janina Pohorecki using NODE JS, MongoDB Atlas, and Express.

Here is a screenshot of the application from the students view:
